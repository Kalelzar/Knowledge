* Reflexive Closure

Let $R \in A^n$

The reflexive closure of R is the smallest set
$R' \subseteq A^{n}$ such that $R' \supseteq R$ and $R'$ is a
[[file:Reflexive Relation.org][reflexive relation]].

(Smallest set means that $\forall{}R'' \subseteq  A^{n}$ such that
 $R'' \supseteq R$ and $R''$ is a reflexive relation
\Rightarrow $R'' \supseteq R'$

Let $A$ be a finite [[file:Set.org][set]] and
$R \in A^n$ is a [[file:Relation.org][relation]] represented by a [[file:Matrix.org][matrix]]

To get the reflexive closure of $R$ all you need to do is
convert all '0's along the main diagonal to '1's
** Example

|---+---+---+---+---+---+---|
| 0 | 1 | 1 |   | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 | \Rightarrow | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 |   | 0 | 1 | 1 |
