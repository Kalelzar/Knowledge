* Symmetric Closure

Let $R \in A^n$

The symmetric closure of R is the smallest set
$R' \subseteq A^{n}$ such that $R' \supseteq R$ and $R'$ is a
[[file:Symmetric Relation.org][symmetric relation]].

Let $A$ be a finite [[file:Set.org][set]] and
$R \in A^n$ is a [[file:Relation.org][relation]] represented by a [[file:Matrix.org][matrix]]

Check for pairs (0,1) (1,0) in cells symmetric along
the main diagonal.
Turn all 0 to 1

|---+---+---+---+---+---+---|
| 0 | 1 | 1 |   | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 | \Rightarrow | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 |   | 1 | 1 | 0 |
