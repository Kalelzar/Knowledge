* Linear order
A [[file:Relation.org][relation]] is a linear order when it is [[file:Reflexive Relation.org][reflexive]],
[[file:Strongly Anti-symmetric Relation.org][strongly anti-symmetric]] and [[file:Transitive Relation.org][transitive]].

Obviously all linear orders are [[file:Partial order.org][partial orders]].
The opposite is not always true. (Think squares and rectangles)
** Maximum and minimum in a linear order

If A is a finite set then there are exactly one minimum
and maximum elements (which coincide if the set has exactly one element.

The opposite is not true. There may be exactly one
min/max elements in a linear order.

If A is infinite then there may not be a maximum/minimum element.
