* Class of equivalence
Let $R \in A^2$ be a [[file:Relation of Equivalence.org][Relation of Equivalence]].

Then the class of equivalence of element $a \in A$ are
defined by the [[file:Set.org][Set]] $[a] = \{ b \in A | aRb\}$.


The classes of equivalence of the relation are
[[file:Partition.org][Partitions]] of the Set $A$
