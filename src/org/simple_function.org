* Simple Function
A simple function is defined by the properties:
+ Easy to calculate
+ Good analytic properties
+ Easy to integrate/differentiate
+ Approximates a wide class of function

** Types

*** Algebraic Polynomial

\[p(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{n}a_{k}x^{k}\]

*** Trigonometric Polynomial

\[\tau(x) = a_0 + \sum_{k=1}^{n}a_{k}\cos(kx) + b_{k}\sin(kx)\]

Since $\tau(x + 2\pi) = \tau(x)$ it's suitable
for approximating $2\pi$ periodic functions

For $2l$ periodic functions you can also use $q(x) = \tau(\frac{\pi{}x}{l})$

*** Spline functions

Made up of multiple polynomials joined together

\begin{equation*}
f(x)=
\begin{cases}
x^{2} + 2x & x < -1\\
x, &1 \geq x \geq -1\\
-x^{2} + 2x & x > 1\\
\end{cases}
\end{equation*}
