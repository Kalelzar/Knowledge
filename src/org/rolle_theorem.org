Put simply if a function differentiable in $[a,b]$ has two points with
the same functional value than atleast one point between them has a derivative
of 0, that is to say 'What comes up, must come down' and vice versa.

* Rolle Theorem
Let $f \in C^1[x_0, x_1]$
If $f(x_0) = f(x_1) \Rightarrow \exists\xi \in [x_{0}, x_{1}]: f'(\xi)=0$
