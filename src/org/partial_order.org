* Partial order
A [[file:relation.org][Relation]] is a partial order when it is [[file:reflexive_relation.org][reflexive]],
[[file:anti-symmetric_relation.org][anti-symmetric]] and [[file:transitive_relation.org][transitive]].
** Maximum and minimum in a partial order
Let $R \subseteq A^{2}$

$\forall a \in A$ we say that it is *minimum* in R if
$\lnot\exists{}b\in{}A,b\neq{}a: bRa$

$\forall a \in A$ we say that it is *maximum* in R if
$\lnot\exists{}b\in{}A,b\neq{}a: aRb$

There may be more than one minimum/maximum elements

There also may be none
