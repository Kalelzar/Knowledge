The original idea was to have some sort of wiki with
my notes from Uni in it. I had previous attempts to transcribe
notes to [[file:org-mode.org][Org-mode]] and was satisfied with the results.

Previously though I just put everything in one big file
this time I decided to use [[file:org_roam.org][Org Roam]].

** Goal

I want to have a functioning website generated by exporting
from ~org-mode~ files.

Have the graph nodes open the page associated.

There have been issues on this front. Since tags in html are apparently
different than the ones in html.
