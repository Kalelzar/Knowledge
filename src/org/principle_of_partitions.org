* Principle of partitions
If $X$ is a [[file:Set.org][set]] and
$\gamma = \{Y_{1}, Y_{2}, \cdots, Y_{k}\}$ is a [[file:Partition.org][Partition]] of $X$.

then $|X| = |Y_1| + |Y_2| + |Y_3| + \cdots + |Y_k|$

*** Alternative Formulation

If $A, B$ are sets
$A \cap B = \emptyset$ and
$|A|=n, |B|=m$
then $|A \cup B| = |A|+|B| = n + m$

By induction this is true for $\forall{}k \in N$
