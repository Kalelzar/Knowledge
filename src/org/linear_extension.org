* Linear extension
Let $R \subseteq A^{2}$ be a [[file:Partial order.org][Partial order]], $R' \subseteq A^{2}$
is a [[file:Linear order.org][Linear order]] and $R\subseteq R'$.

Then R' is a linear extension of R.


For $A = \{a_1,\cdots,a_{n}\}$ the number of linear extensions can vary greatly.

From 1 (R is a linear order) to n! (there are no comparable elements in R)
