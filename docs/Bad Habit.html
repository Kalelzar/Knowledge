Maybe another project or some form of entertainment. The problem is when I am done/have abandoned that I rarely come back to an unfinished project. It's <span class="underline">old,</span> you know? Old and boring. And every day it seems that something new and exciting comes out. </p> <p> And I have to try it out. </p> <p> I can't really see a way of fixing this in the short-term. </p> <p> And it's not really a priority anyway. The thing I have the most beef with isn't the fact that I abandon projects, but that I forget about them. I forget why I needed them, planned features and sometimes I forget about their existance entirely. </p> <p> Recently the thing that occupies my attention is <a href="/Knowledge/Org%20Roam.html">org-roam</a> and the publishing system for it. </p> <p> And so I thought up a thing. I already have all these files here, why not make one for each project with the relevant info. It's not exactly some revolutionary idea but it would be nice to have (notice the implicit creation of a new project). </p> <p> I could also take notes for project ideas. Stuff that I've thought about but for some reason or another decided not to try and do. </p> <p> Without further ado: <a href="/Knowledge/Projects.html">Projects</a> </p> </div> </section> <section id="outline-container-orgff49ee6" class="outline-2"> <h2 id="orgff49ee6"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> Backlinks</h2> <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2"> <ul class="org-ul"> <li><a href="/Knowledge/recentchanges.html">Recent changes</a></li> </ul> </div> </section> </div> <div id="temp-network" style="display:none"></div></div></div></div></body></html>
